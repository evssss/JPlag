Question 1:  secret code

#secret_code.py
# a program that changes a sentence that the user has entered
# the user types a sentence
# the porgram then ask for THREE pairs of letters to change or swap out
# the letter befpore the comma should be the original letter.
# The letter after the comma should be the new letter that replaces the origianl one.
# three sets of letters shold be requested
# the program then displays the sentence that results from swapping those 3 letter pairs.

# input - a random sentence from the user
# output - the same sentence with a letters chosen by the user changed (3 letters must be changed)

def main(): # defining the main funtion
    print("Welcome! This is a program that will change any letters of your choosing in the sentence you decide to enter!")
    # welcome message to tell user what the program does
    sentence = input("Please enter the sentence you want to use: ") # asking user to enter a sentence and storing it in "sentence"

    for i in range(3): # loop when you know the definitive amount of times it needs to be run (in this case 3)
        original, new = input("Please enter a letter in your sentence you would like to change and a new letter to change it to. (making sure to separate the letters by a comma): ").split(",")
        # asking the user to input the old letter and the new one they want to replace it with ot create the new sentence.
        sentence = sentence.replace(original, new) # replacing the original letters by the new letters

    print("The new sentence you have created by switching out these letters is: ") # goodbye message
    print(sentence) # new sentence

main() # closing function

Question 2: reading

#reading.py
# a program to read a list of word (each line) and in a new file on each line print the following:
# print the original word
# print "contains"
# print the numbr of letters the word has
# this should be done for all lines
# both files should be closed

#input - reading words in another file
# output - printing the original word with "contains" and the number of letters the word has.


def main(): #defining the main function
    letters = 0 # starting letters counter at 0

    infileName = input("What is the name of the file you would like to be opened? ") # asking for the user to name file they created
    outfileName = input("What is the name of the new file you would like to be created? ") # asking for the user to name file they WANT to be created

    infile = open(infileName, "r") # open file and read the content
    savefile = open(outfileName, "w") # #creates the new output file

    for line in infile: # for each line in the input file
        letters += len(line) # add the length of the word on the line to the letters counter
        message = (line, "contains", letters, "letters\n")  # the new formatted message
        savefile.write(message)  # save this message in the new file with the word "contains" and the number of letters in each line

    infile.close() #close the infile
    savefile.close() #close the new file

    print("\n A new file", outfileName, "has been created containing the words with the letter count. ")
    # print message that will appear on the screen with the outfile name and a message stating it has the letter count.

main()


Question 5 : names

#names.py
# a program to sort names into 3 lists: short, medium and long
# a short name  is 4 characters or less
# a  medium name is between 5 and 8 characters
# a long name is more than 8 characters long
# program then loops through the original list of 6 names that were collected.
# based on the number of letters in the name, the name is added to one of the other three lists
# eg. the name jos√© would be added to the list with shorter names
# after names are added ot the three corresponding lists, the 3 lists are printed out

# input - 6 NAMES inputed by user
# output - names are sorted into 3 lists: short, medium and long

def sort(Firstnames): # defining the sort function
    short = [] # naming empty list for short names
    medium= [] # naming empty list for medium names
    long = [] # naming empty list for long names

    for names in Firstnames: #loop to determine the length of each name
        if len(names) <= 4: # if length of name is smaller or equal to 4
            short.append(names) # add it to the short names list

        elif 5 <= len(names) <= 8: # if length of name is between  bigger than or equal to 5 and smaller than or equal to 8
            medium.append(names) # add it to the medium names list

        else: # if it is none of the other options
            long.append(names)  # add it to the long names list

    return short, medium, long # to return the codes to the corresponding lists (otherwise nothing will be stored)

def main(): #defining main function
    Firstnames = [] #naming the empty list Firstnames
    for i in range(6): # loop with a known number of entries (in this case 6)
        names = input("Please enter a random name of your choosing: ") # a message for user to imput a random name of their choosing
        Firstnames.append(names) # adding the names to the list firstnames

    short, medium, long = sort(Firstnames) # to sort the names into the corresponding lists

    print("From the list provided by the user, the short names that were entered are :", short) #message printed for list short names
    print("From the list provided by the user, the medium names that were entered are: ", medium)#message printed for list short names
    print("From the list provided by the user, the Long names that were entered are:", long) #message printed for list short names

main()
